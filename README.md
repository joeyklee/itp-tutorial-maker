# ITP Tutorial Maker

A tool for building tutorials using a db of tagged and vetted resources. The idea is to make it easy for people to put projects by stiching together a series of resources.

## Setup

```
mongod

```
cd itp-resource-collector-api
npm start
```

3. Run the app in **terminal window #3**
