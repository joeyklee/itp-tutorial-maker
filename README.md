# ITP Tutorial Maker

<!-- 
A tool for building tutorials using a db of tagged and vetted resources. The idea is to make it easy for people to put projects by stiching together a series of resources. -->

**What is this?**
This is a simple tool to make tutorials based on a project idea. You start with an idea and you fill in the building blocks (sections) with the resources to make your idea a reality. 

**Why would I use this?**
You're an educator of some sort, maybe even a student, and you're trying to document some kind of pathway, or magical track, along which to follow to turn an idea into reality. 

We recognize learning is not linear and sometimes it doesn't make sense to go from top to bottom, but in general our goal is help provide some structure to the curation process of making learning materials that are reusable, remixable, and magical.
